published by SeeMeCNC's John Oly for all to enjoy.  Please follow sublime's license wishes as for the origional files linked below

for the origional files, as well as instructions to build it.  These files are merely the origional files as of 11/12/2012, taken and modified into laser cuttable files.  The origionals were made from .stl files, and were full of splines and poor line geometry, which resulted in massive amounts of wasted time in machining.   

For any questions relating to these specific files only, please email johnoly99@gmail.com
For questions on the tantillus itself, please see sublime's github or contact him at http://tantillus.org
